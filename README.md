# Super-Bowl-2018
I have used three datasets game data, TV data and halftime musician data. 
After loading, cleaning and exploring the data, I visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. I used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. 
And discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
